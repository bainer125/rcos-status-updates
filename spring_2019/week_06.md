## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Did a bit more searching for libraries and wrote pseudocode, but it was a pretty busy week and I wasn't\
> able to put a lot of time into it.

## This Week's Plan

> Next week I'll probably make up for this week's lack of production and get our thermal array working. My\
> personal goal is to get readable data output to the terminal by the end of next week.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking
