## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I communicated what kind of software we needed to get running on the Raspberry Pi and\
> helped install everything. We also decided on how we were going to read data from the room using our\
> sensors.

## This Week's Plan

> Next week, we plan on installing the sensors and getting basic I/O working in order to get raw data.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking

## Notes

> Should be able to really get the ball rolling here next week.
