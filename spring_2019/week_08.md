## Last Week's Accomplishments

> New sensor came in, but it had to be soldered to get working. I got wires soldered to the sensor and\
> set up decently long wires to the Raspberry Pi for testing purposes. Confirmed it was working\
> correctly and got it Matt for testing. I also (finally) found a good library to work with the thermal\
> array and Raspberry Pi and I showed it to Matt so he could get it operational.

## This Week's Plan

> Next up is to get the code implemented from the library and manipulate the sensor's data for the\
> purposes of our own project.

## Anything Blocking?

> Same as usual, we only have one prototype to split between four developers; makes it hard to work\
> on.
