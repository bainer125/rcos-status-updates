## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Spent numerous hours in the IoT lab with the RPi and sensors. Tried to get the thermal array\
> recognised using i2cdetect, which had been working up until this point, but it wouldn't work. After\
> eliminating all other possible problems, we concluded that the sensor was broken and we would\
> have to order a new one.

## This Week's Plan

> Wait for the new sensor and make that one work.

## Anything Blocking?

> We need a new sensor and it won't be here for a few days.

## Notes

> We are not happy about the sensor
