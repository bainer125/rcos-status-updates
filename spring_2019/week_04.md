## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The sensors came in the mail so hardware team met to get them all set up and tested. We got SDA\
> and SDL I/O working correctly for our sensors, however we didn't get a working library set up.

## This Week's Plan

> Next is to get a remote setup working so we all can develop without having to set aside time to\
> all meet in the same place.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking aside from no remote server.
