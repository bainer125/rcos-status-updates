## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I did a bunch of research on hardware sensors and servers to figure out what would be best \
> for our situation. After confirming the capabilities of the all of the hardware, I ordered all of the hardware \
> parts we need in order to get started on prototyping.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Next week, we plan on starting the prototyping process for the hardware system of our project.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The only thing blocking us right now is the shipping of the hardware. We can't work on prototyping until the \
> sensors and Raspberry pi are here.
