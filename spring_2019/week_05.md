## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had to delegate the task of setting up the Raspberry Pi for remote access to Matthew due to a time\
> shortage for me. He had troubles with it, however, so we decided that setting up meetings would be\
> easier, albeit a pain to develop. Continued to look for a good library for our thermal array but none\
> worked to our needs.

## This Week's Plan

> Next week we'll be having two hardware hack-sessions in order to establish good framework software\
> for the sensors.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking
